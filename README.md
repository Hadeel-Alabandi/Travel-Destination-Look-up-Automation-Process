# Travel-Destination-Look-up-Automation-Process
It will automate the process of finding a destination under specific category to travel to that meets the user stay in budget.
The user first needs to enter data like check in/out dates, number of (adults, children, rooms), destination category, budget, living location, then the bot will start the process of looking up and finding a destination from the list of destinations under the chosen category that meets the user budget.
Once a destination that meets user stay in budget found, user input required to either accept this destination or ask to find another destination either based on the same input or new input. 
Collecting stay in budget data is done by scraping data from booking.com, then cleaning and claculation is done to find the average budget. 
If the user accept found destination, places to visit is scrapped from google places to visit, and the user will be required to enter thier email. 
Finally an email will be sent with the destination, country and the continent, and the minimum, maximum and the average cost will be included as well. Two excel files will be attached, places to stay in and places to visit.
